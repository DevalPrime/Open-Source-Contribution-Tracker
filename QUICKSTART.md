### Tips

- Without a GitHub token, you're limited to 60 API requests per hour
- With a token, you get 5,000 requests per hour
- The app uses in-memory storage, so data resets when the server restarts
- For production use, consider adding database integration

### Troubleshooting

**GitHub API Rate Limit**
- If you see "403" errors, you've hit the rate limit
- Add a GitHub Personal Access Token to `.env`
- Wait an hour for the rate limit to reset

**Port Already in Use**
- Change the PORT in `.env` file
- Or stop other applications using port 3000

**Server Won't Start**
- Ensure Node.js v14+ is installed
- Run `npm install` again
- Check for error messages in the console

### Next Steps

- Explore the API endpoints in the README
- Customize the frontend styling in `public/styles.css`
- Add more features or integrations
- Consider adding database support for persistent storage

Enjoy tracking your open source contributions! ðŸš€
